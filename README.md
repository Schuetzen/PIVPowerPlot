# PIVPowerPlot

This Python script is designed to read velocity data from MATLAB .mat files, process this data, and create visualizations of velocity components. It operates by reading filenames from a specified folder, processing each file to extract and filter velocity data, and generating plots for both individual and aggregate datasets.
